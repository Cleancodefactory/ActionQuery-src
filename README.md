# ActionQuery-src

> Note: This repository contains only the source code of the library. It is intended to be mounted as a submodule in other repositories that contain projects using it. For documentation and examples see the [ActionQuery](https://github.com/Cleancodefactory/ActionQuery) repository.

The library is also available as a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ccf.Ck.Libs.ActionQuery/). Please note that the nuget can be published with some delay, if you need always the latest version use it as a Git submodule and reference the project.
